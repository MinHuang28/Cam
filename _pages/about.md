I am a First-year PhD student at the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My research interests include computational modelling, structural geology, and geodynamics.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. John Rudge](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/directory/john-rudge) of Bullard Labolatories from the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge. Now I'm working on the project about reaction-infiltration instability of melt migration in the mantle.

This website serves as a diary for my PhD life. You are more than welcome to talk to me about similar academic topics.
