I'm a First year PhD student from [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My research interest includes computational modeling, strutural geology, and geodynamics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. John Rudge](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/directory/john-rudge) of Bullard Labolatories from [Department of Earth Sciences].
