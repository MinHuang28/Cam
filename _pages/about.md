I am now a second-year PhD student at the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My research interests include computational modelling, geodynamics, and structural geology.

My PhD research focuses on the reaction-infiltration instability of melt migration in the mantle. I'm using DOLFINx and Python. My primary supervisor is [Prof. John Rudge](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/directory/john-rudge) of Bullard Labolatories.

This website serves as a diary for my PhD life. You are more than welcome to talk to me about similar academic topics.
