Publications
======
* M. Huang, Y. Zhou, L. Lu, W. Zheng & P. Zhang (2019). **Some Thoughts on Measuring Earthquake Deformation Using Optical Imagery, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing**, 58(2), 1052-1062. DOI:[10.1109/TGRS.2019.2943192](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8878012)\\
Contribution:
  * Compiled and analysed all the earthquakes that have been investigated with optical image matching by 2019
  * Proposed a new DEM-based method using the ALOS World 3D DEM to reduce the orthorectification errors
  * Re-analysed coseismic slip distribution and shallow slip deficit (SSD) and found that the SSD model may primarily be artefacts in the measurements

* M. Huang, Y. Li & L. Zhao (2022). **Effects of Heterogeneous Thermal, Compositional and Rheological Properties on the Long-Term Evolution of Deep Mantle Thermochemical Piles**, Science China: Earth Science, 1-12. DOI:[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-021-9950-7]( https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-021-9950-7)\\
Contribution:
  * Performed a series of numerical experiments over a range of buoyancy ratios, compositional viscosity ratios, and internal heating rates and analysed their effects to thermochemical piles
  * Compared simulations with constant heating and radioactive decay heating, and found that although simulations with radioactive decay showed a slight decline of the stability of piles, there was little difference among them
